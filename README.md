# Mailchimp Node.js Library

The [Mailchimp API](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com) allows you to sync email activity and campaign stats with your database, manage lists/audiences, view and control automation workflows, and test calls and endpoints before pushing to production.

This Node.js library provides a simple wrapper implementation for the [Mailchimp API](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com) that currently supports basic functionality around creating, editing and deleting members.


## Installation

```shell
$ yarn add @nodepit/mailchimp
```


## Usage

```javascript
import { Mailchimp } from '@nodepit/mailchimp';

const yourApiKey = 'Your Mailchimp API key';
const yourListId= '123456789';

const mailChimp = new Mailchimp(yourApiKey);
await mailChimp.createMember(yourListId, 'mail@example.com', {
  status: MemberStatus.SUBSCRIBED,
  merge_fields: { LNAME: 'Daniel' }
});
```


## Development

Install NPM dependencies with `yarn`.

To execute the tests, run the `test` task.

For the best development experience, make sure that your editor supports [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/third-party-tools/) and [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org).


## Releasing to NPM

Commit all changes and run the following:

```shell
$ npm login
$ npm version <update_type>
$ npm publish --access public
```

â€¦ where `<update_type>` is one of `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. This will update the `package.json`, and create a tagged Git commit with the version number.
